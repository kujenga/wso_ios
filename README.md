# WSO iPhone Application

This app is intended to be a replacement for the existing application on the App store, which now crashes on open on my phone.

## Features
It is planned to implement the following functionality in a tab-based layout
 * Home: a feed of all the Announcements, Exchange, Lost+Found, Jobs, and Rides
 * Search: Allows for easy searching of the Williams Facebook
 * Map: provides a google maps representation of the campus, since google maps has better annotation of building names and paths around campus than Apple maps does
 * *trak: provides access to both Factrak and Dormtrak

## To-do
 * implement a login screen and store user login data persistently
 * figure out API access (see just below)
 * implement search bar functionality, with proper behavior for the keypad, auto-search after a certain number of letters, linking prototype person cells with the code, etc.
 * implement search for *trak, create and link prototype cells relevant for reviews in each case.

## API Access
Need to talk with WSO people about how to interact with servers, can probably use same protocols as the existing app.
